<p>This repository serves two purposes: (1) provide a sample project and (2) ensure all Q3 repositories remain compatible with one another. Although we've taken a headless approach, our client and API packages are often used together to fast-track development. Thus, we need to ensure the progression of one project doesn't introduce breaking changes for another.</p>
